This project will be submitted as a final draft for Weighted Assesment on Week 9, Term 2. 

This project must consist of the use of Flask and any database management to achieve an own set result.
The project must achieve a result to tackle a problem found in real context.

Project log: 

  - 8/8 : i have started the basic set-up of the enviroment and it's required packages. The project is going to be a web-app that assists in the admin tasks of
    mannaging a CCA. i will base the functionalities based on my own CCA; Red Cross Youth.

  - 9/8 : implement register and login processes. lay down the base for permanenent sessions.

  - 10/8 -11/8 : implemented "/logout". realised that for testing any future features i need test data. pushed fresh data to student , teacher & cca tables

  - 12/8 to 18/8 : have been grinding and got the attendance system to work

  - 19/8 to 20/8 : hosted to render go check it out ( https://cca-manager.onrender.com )
    
Project implementable ideas: 
  - attendance system. DONE!!!!
  - assessment (Grade) tracking (Rejected)
  - submission tracking (IN the Future)
  - Tests??? Not sure... Maybe

Future Plan:

- set up a way for students to log into the site and upload their work.
- teachers can setup the assignment to which students can submit work

------BUT--------

render dont have much disk space...
so idk...

it sounds counterintuitive with little disk space and the space just grows and grows as years pass by...
